        <h1>Mulligan, Ford </h1>
        <p>I am a Math/CS student from Boulder, CO attending the University of Colorado campus here in my hometown. 
            I have a black belt in American Kenpo, and have recently gotten into modding for Europa Universalis IV, a grand strategy game by Paradox Interactive.
            I decided to add CS on top of my studies in mathematics after learning to program in Python for Numerical Methods, which made me realize the potential
            of computing for solving problems that you would never want to do by hand.</p>
